### Framework for the integration of TWAS with gene co-expression patterns

![
**Schematic of the PhenoPLIER framework.**

**a)** The integration process between gene co-expression patterns from MultiPLIER (top) and TWAS results from PhenomeXcan.
PhenoPLIER projects gene-based association results on thousands of traits to a latent space learned from large gene expression datasets.
The process generates matrix $\mathbf{\hat{M}}$, where each trait is now described by latent variables (LV) or gene modules.

**b)** After the integration process, we found that neutrophil counts and other white blood cells (bottom) were ranked among the top 10 traits for an LV that was termed a neutrophil signature in the original MultiPLIER study.
Genes in this LV are expressed in relevant cell types (top).

In Figure @fig:entire_process, we show the main components of PhenoPLIER, our framework to integrate TWAS and gene co-expression patterns.
The framework combines TWAS results with gene co-expression patterns by projecting gene-trait associations on a latent gene expression representation.
We used PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083], a massive TWAS resource on the UK Biobank [@doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z] and other cohorts that provides results for 4,091 different diseases and traits.
The latent gene expression representation was obtained by applying MultiPLIER [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], an unsupervised learning approach, on recount2 [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838].
Each of the 987 latent variables (LV) represents a gene module, essentially a group of genes with coordinated expression patterns (i.e., expressed together in the same tissues and cell types).
Since modules might represent a functional set of genes regulated by the same transcriptional program [@doi:10.1186/1471-2164-7-187; @doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1835-8], the projection of TWAS results into this latent space might provide context for their interpretation (see Methods).
<!--  -->
Our approach translates gene-trait associations to a gene module-trait score, allowing us to explore how different traits and diseases related to modules expressed in specific cell types and tissues, even under different developmental stages or stimuli.
<!--  -->
This is possible because the MultiPLIER models also provide the experimental conditions (represented by matrix $\mathbf{B}$ in Figure @fig:entire_process a) in which genes in a module are concurringly expressed.


In the original MultiPLIER study, the authors found an LV significantly associated with a known neutrophil pathway and highly correlated with neutrophil estimates from gene expression.
<!--  -->
We analyzed this LV using our approach (Figure @fig:entire_process b), and found that
1) neutrophil counts and other white blood cell traits from PhenomeXcan were ranked among the top 10 traits for this LV,
and 2) that the genes in this LV were expressed in neutrophil and other relevant cells.
<!--  -->
Moreover, using a generalized least squares approach similar to the gene-property analysis in MAGMA [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004219], we found that gene weights in this LV were predictive of gene associations for neutrophil count and percentage (FDR < 0.01) (see Methods).
<!--  -->
These initial results strongly suggested that shared patterns exist in the gene expression space (which has no GTEx samples) and the TWAS space (with gene models trained using GTEx v8);
the approach also allows inferring the context-specific effects of gene modules on complex traits.
<!--  -->
We also show how the approach can aid translational efforts by mapping pharmacological perturbations to this latent space, enabling us to observe which compounds affect the transcriptional activity of gene modules.
