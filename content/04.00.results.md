This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of using gene co-expression networks to project genetic

Our study revealed that gene co-expression patterns can be used to project genetic associations to gene expression levels, and that these projections can be used to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
We applied MultiPLIER, PhenomeXcan,
