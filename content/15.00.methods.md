## Methods

### MultiPLIER and Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER)

MultiPLIER [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] extracts patterns of co-expressed genes from recount2 [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838], a large gene expression dataset.
The approach applies the pathway-level information extractor method (PLIER) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1], which performs unsupervised learning using prior knowledge (cannonical pathways) to reduce technical noise.
Via a matrix factorization approach, PLIER deconvolutes the gene expression data into a set of latent variables (LV), where each represents a gene module (i.e. a set of genes with coordinated expression patterns).
This reduced the data dimensionality into 987 latent variables.

Given a gene expression dataset $\mathbf{Y}^{n \times p}$ with $n$ genes and $p$ conditions and a prior knowledge matrix $\mathbf{C} \in \{0,1\}^{n \times m}$ for $m$ gene sets (so that $\mathbf{C}_{ij} = 1$ if gene $i$ belongs to gene set $j$), (e.g., gene sets from MSigDB [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004]), PLIER finds $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{Z}$, and $\mathbf{B}$ minimizing

$$
||\mathbf{Y} - \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{B}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_1 ||\mathbf{Z} - \mathbf{C}\mathbf{U}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_2 ||\mathbf{B}||^{2}_{F} + \lambda_3 ||\mathbf{U}||_{L^1}
$$ {#eq:met:plier_func}

subject to $\mathbf{U}>0, \mathbf{Z}>0$;
$\mathbf{Z}^{n \times l}$ are the gene loadings with $l$ latent variables,
$\mathbf{B}^{l \times p}$ is the latent space for $p$ conditions,
$\mathbf{U}^{m \times l}$ specifies which of the $m$ prior-information gene sets in $\mathbf{C}$ are represented for each LV,
and $\lambda_i$ are different regularization parameters used in the training step.
<!--  -->
$\mathbf{Z}$ is a low-dimensional representation of the gene space where each LV aligns as much as possible to prior knowledge and it might represent a known or novel gene module (i.e., a meaningful biological pattern) or noise.

### Drug-disease predictions

**NOT FINISHED**

We used the dot product of the S-PrediXcan $z$-score for each gene-disease pair, and the $z$-score for each gene-drug pair in LINCS L1000, multiplied by -1.

To obtain a drug-disease association for the gene module-mapped TWAS results, we first projected LINCS L1000 data into this latent representation using Equation (@eq:proj), thus leading to a matrix with the expression profiles of drugs mapped to latent variables.
This can be interpreted as the effects of compounds on gene modules activity.
Then, similarly as before, we anti-correlated gene module-traits scores and module expression profiles of drugs.
