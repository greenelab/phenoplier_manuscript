## Discussion

- the importance to invest more resources in finding gene co-expression patterns
- to increase the number of potential gene modules

- one disadvantage is that we have a limited amount of genes, only 6.000 out of 22k
in phenomexcan; more sophisticated methods for gene co-expression pattern discovery are
needed to expand the implications of these analysis and cover more contexts.

- this limited amount of genes makes our approach biased to already known pathways
and mechanisms
