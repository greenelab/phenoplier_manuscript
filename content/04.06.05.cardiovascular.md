#### Cardiovascular traits

::: {style="color: red"}
See if we are going to analyze this cluster.

The figures below include examples of the type of figure we can include here:

- Show the LVs that are distinct for this cluster (maybe a small decision tree
  for some of the clusters).
- For those LV, show which cell types/tissues are important (such as Figure
  @fig:lv136_conditions below).
- For some of these LVs, we can include the list of other traits also related
  and gene association results (such as Figure @fig:lv136_traits).
