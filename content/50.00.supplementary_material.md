### Top latent variables associated with neutrophils

::: {style="color: red"}
**NOT FINISHED**

This section aims to show that the top LVs related to neutrophil counts are more correlated to neutrophil counts or esimates than expected by chance.
Probably I just need to add a proper caption for each figure, and reference them from the main text.
