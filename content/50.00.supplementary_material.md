### Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER)

MultiPLIER [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], the computational strategy used in
this work, extracts patterns of co-expressed genes on large gene expression
datasets. MultiPLIER applies the pathway-level information extractor method
(PLIER) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1] to the recount2 data
[@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838], which performs unsupervised learning using prior
knowledge to reduce technical noise. Via a matrix factorization approach, PLIER
deconvolutes the gene expression data into a set of latent variables (LV) that
each represent a gene module (i.e. a set of genes with coordinated expression
patterns).

#### Ensemble combination and consensus functions

::: {style="color: red"}
- evidence accumulation approach
- we also used a spectral clustering approach
- for each k, we picked the partition that maximized the agreement with the ensemble
- show figure where we select the ks that are greater than the median

#### Clusters interpretation

**Heatmap of the scores between gene modules (with their pathways) and traits from the main clusters.**

`(Early draft version; instead of this figure, we might want to just add a table with information about LVs)`{.red}
<!--  -->
The plot shows a submatrix of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ for the main trait clusters shown at the bottom of the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree), considering only gene modules that align well with at least one known pathway.
For gene modules (rows), labels on the right show all significantly associated pathways.
Values range from -5 (lighter color) to 16 (darker color).
