### LVs predict drug-disease pairs better than single genes

We tested how well our LV-based approach could predict known drug-disease relationships.
We used transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], which were processed and mapped to DrugBank IDs [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1068; @doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47223].
We adopted a previously described framework [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] to prioritize drug candidates, which uses imputed transcriptomes from TWAS.
We computed a drug-disease score by calculating the negative dot product between the $z$-scores for a disease (from TWAS) and the $z$-scores for a drug (from LINCS) across sets of genes of different sizes (see [Methods](#sec:methods:drug)).
We also estimated how pharmacological perturbations affected the gene module activity by projecting expression profiles of drugs into our latent representation (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b).
We used a manually-curated gold standard set of drug-disease medical indications [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47664] for 322 drugs across 53 diseases to evaluate the prediction performance.

In addition, the clustering of complex traits (Figure @fig:drug_disease:clustering) based on the inferred gene-trait associations revealed distinct subgroups of diseases.

The results of our study indicate that the latent space-based method is able to project gene-trait associations and drug-induced expression profiles, capturing biologically meaningful patterns.
The method outperformed the gene-based one with an area under the curve of 0.632 and an average precision of 0.858 (Figure @fig:drug_disease:roc_pr).
Furthermore, the clustering of complex traits (Figure @fig:drug_disease:clustering) revealed distinct subgroups of diseases.
These results suggest that this low-dimensional space can link pathophysiological processes with the mechanism of action of drugs.


We examined a specific drug-disease pair to determine whether the latent variables (LVs) driving the prediction were biologically plausible.
Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a B vitamin widely used to treat lipid disorders, although its efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease is controversial.
Niacin has multiple tissue effects, although its mechanisms are not well understood.
It increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by inhibiting an HDL catabolism receptor in the liver and decreases low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by modulating triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes or by inhibiting adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis.
Niacin was included in the gold standard set for atherosclerosis (AT) and coronary artery disease (CAD).
We observed that this compound was predicted by the gene-based and LV-based approach as a medical indication for CAD, with scores above the mean (0.51 and 0.96, respectively).
For AT, the LV-based approach predicted niacin as a therapeutic drug with a score of 0.52, whereas the gene-based method assigned a negative score of -0.01 (below the mean).
LV246 (Figure @fig:lv246) was the 16th most important module in the prediction of niacin as a therapeutic drug for AT; it is expressed in adipose tissue and liver and associated with plasma lipids and high cholesterol (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246).
LV246 was also among the top modules for other cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease (wide definition, 15th module) and high cholesterol (7th module).

This analysis suggests that the antiatherogenic effects of niacin are due to its activation of GPR109A in immune cells, which boosts anti-inflammatory processes, and its activation of GPR109A in Langerhans cells, which produces flushing.

Analysis of the top niacin-contributing LVs across different cardiovascular diseases revealed additional mechanisms of action.
GPR109A/HCAR2 encodes a G protein-coupled high-affinity niacin receptor in adipocytes and immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2006.05.008; @doi:10.1038/sj.jid.5700586].
Initially, it was thought that the antiatherogenic effects of niacin were due to the inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue.
However, it has been shown that nicotinic acid can reduce atherosclerosis progression independently of its antidyslipidemic activity by activating GPR109A in immune cells [@doi:10.1172/JCI41651], thus boosting anti-inflammatory processes [@doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179283].
Additionally, flushing, a common adverse effect of niacin, is produced by the activation of GPR109A in Langerhans cells (macrophages of the skin).
This alternative mechanism for niacin was suggested by examining the cell types where the top-contributing modules were expressed.
For example, LV116 and LV931 (Figure @fig:lv116:cell_types, Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv931, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv116 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv931) were the top two modules for AT and had a strong signature in monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and others.
Figure @fig:lv116:cell_types showed LV116's genes were expressed as an immune response when these cell types were under different stimuli, such as diarrhea caused by different pathogens [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0192082], samples from multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109760; @doi:10.1126/science.aac7442], or infected with different viruses (such as herpes simplex [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA258384], West Nile virus [@doi:10.3390/v5071664], *Salmonella typhimurium* [@doi:10.1038/srep16882]).
LV246, LV116, and LV931 were among the top 20 modules contributing to the niacin prediction across different cardiovascular traits (Table @tbl:niacin:cardio:top_lvs).
This suggests that the antiatherogenic effects of niacin are due to its activation of GPR109A in immune cells, which boosts anti-inflammatory processes, and its activation of GPR109A in Langerhans cells, which produces flushing.

LV66, one of the top LVs affected by niacin, was mainly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells.
This suggests that niacin may have potential therapeutic applications in ovarian diseases.
This is supported by recent studies that found that niacin promotes follicle growth and inhibits granulosa cell apoptosis in animal models [@doi:10.1159/000495051; @doi:10.1071/RD20306].
(See Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv66).
