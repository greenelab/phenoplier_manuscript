### LVs predict drug-disease pairs better than single genes

We then tested how well substituting LVs for individual genes could predict known treatment-disease relationships.
To do this, we used transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], which were further processed and mapped to DrugBank IDs [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1068; @doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47223].
We adopted a previously described framework that uses imputed transcriptomes from TWAS to prioritize drug candidates [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
This framework calculates a drug-disease score by taking the negative dot product between the $z$-scores for a disease (from TWAS) and the $z$-scores for a drug (from LINCS) across sets of genes of different sizes (see [Methods](#sec:methods:drug)).
A large score for a drug-disease pair indicates that higher (lower) predicted expression values of disease-associated genes are down (up)-regulated by the drug, suggesting a potential treatment.
For the LV-based approach, we estimated how pharmacological perturbations affected the gene module activity by projecting expression profiles of drugs into our latent representation (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b).
We used a manually-curated gold standard set of drug-disease medical indications [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47664] for 322 drugs across 53 diseases to evaluate the prediction performance.

Our results show that the latent space-based method outperforms the gene-based one, with an area under the curve of 0.632 and an average precision of 0.858 (Figure @fig:drug_disease:roc_pr).
This suggests that the low-dimensional space captures biologically meaningful patterns, linking pathophysiological processes to the mechanism of action of drugs, even though the gene-trait associations and drug-induced expression profiles projected into the space represent a compressed version of the entire set of results.


We tested a specific drug-disease pair to assess if the latent variables (LVs) driving the prediction were biologically plausible.
Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a B vitamin used to treat lipid disorders and is sometimes prescribed for cardiovascular disease prevention.
Its effects are not well understood.
Niacin can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by inhibiting an HDL catabolism receptor in the liver and it can decrease low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by modulating triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes or by inhibiting adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis.
In our gold standard set, niacin was indicated for atherosclerosis (AT) and coronary artery disease (CAD).
We found that it was predicted as a medical indication for CAD by both the gene-based and LV-based approach with scores above the mean (0.51 and 0.96, respectively).
The LV-based approach also predicted niacin as a therapeutic drug for AT with a score of 0.52, but the gene-based method assigned a negative score of -0.01 (below the mean).
We then analyzed which LVs positively contributed to these predictions.
Notably, LV246 (Figure @fig:lv246), expressed in adipose tissue and liver and associated with plasma lipids and high cholesterol (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246), was the 16th most important module in the prediction of niacin as a therapeutic drug for AT.
Additionally, LV246 was among the top modules for other cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease (wide definition, 15th module) and high cholesterol (7th module).

Analysis of the top contributing LVs to niacin across different cardiovascular diseases revealed further mechanisms of action.
For example, *GPR109A/HCAR2* encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to niacin in adipocytes and immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2006.05.008; @doi:10.1038/sj.jid.5700586].
Initially, it was believed that the antiatherogenic effects of niacin were due to its inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue.
However, it has been demonstrated that nicotinic acid can reduce atherosclerosis progression independently of its antidyslipidemic activity by activating *GPR109A* in immune cells [@doi:10.1172/JCI41651], thus boosting anti-inflammatory processes [@doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179283].
Additionally, flushing, a common side effect of niacin, is also caused by the activation of GPR109A in Langerhans cells (macrophages of the skin).
This alternative mechanism could have been predicted by examining the cell types in which the top-contributing modules are expressed.
For instance, LV116 and LV931 (Figure @fig:lv116:cell_types, Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv931, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv116 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv931) were the top two modules for AT, with a strong signature in monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and others.
In Figure @fig:lv116:cell_types, it can be seen that LV116's genes are expressed in an immune response when these cell types are exposed to different stimuli, such as diarrhea caused by various pathogens [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0192082], samples from multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109760; @doi:10.1126/science.aac7442], or infected with different viruses (such as herpes simplex [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA258384], West Nile virus [@doi:10.3390/v5071664], *Salmonella typhimurium* [@doi:10.1038/srep16882], among others).
These three LVs (LV246, LV116 and LV931) were among the top 20 modules contributing to the niacin prediction across different cardiovascular traits (Table @tbl:niacin:cardio:top_lvs).

LV66, one of the top LVs affected by niacin, was mainly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells.
This has recently led to the consideration of niacin as a potential therapeutic for ovarian diseases [@doi:10.1159/000495051; @doi:10.1071/RD20306], as it was found to promote follicle growth and inhibit granulosa cell apoptosis in animal models.
This suggests that niacin could be a useful tool in uncovering the etiology of complex diseases beyond cardiovascular traits.
