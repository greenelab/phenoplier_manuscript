### LVs reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

![
**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on 3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the input data, and five different clustering algorithms processed all data versions.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits was grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different numbers of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions were represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function were used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

We used a projection of gene-trait associations into the latent space to find groups of clusters linked by the same transcriptional processes.
We designed a consensus clustering framework that combines solutions or partitions of traits generated by different methods ([Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
This approach has been recommended to avoid several pitfalls when performing cluster analysis on biological data [@doi:10.1126/scisignal.aad1932].
We generated different data versions using different methods with varying sets of parameters (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}a).
A consensus function then combined the ensemble into a consolidated solution which outperformed any individual member of the ensemble [@Strehl2002; @doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113].
This resulted in 15 final consensus clustering solutions (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:clustering:agreement).
The number of clusters (between 5 to 29) was selected based on the partitions with the largest agreement with the ensemble [@Strehl2002].
We used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to examine stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions.
To understand which latent variables differentiated the groups of traits, we trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}b, see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition.
The number of clusters goes from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

We found that phenotypes grouped into five branches (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
The “large” branch (0) included most of the traits, with asthma, subjective well-being traits, and nutrient intake clusters only starting at $k$=16.
The other branches were heel bone-densitometry measurements (1), hematological assays on red blood cells (2), physical measures (3) (including spirometry and body impedance, and anthropometric traits with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches), and a “complex” branch (4) (including keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as other cardiovascular-related traits such as hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160], and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet).
Results were relatively stable across different resolutions, with the same traits often clustered together.
Arrows between clusters showed traits moving from one group to another, mainly between clusters within the “complex” branch (4) and between clusters from the “large” branch (0) to the “complex” branch.
This behavior is expected since complex diseases are usually associated with shared genetic and environmental factors.
Supplementary Files 3-6 provide further clustering results.

**Cluster-specific and general transcriptional processes associated with different diseases.**
The plot shows a submatrix of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ for the main trait clusters at $k$=29, considering only LVs (rows) that are well-aligned with at least one pathway.

We identified the top latent variables (LVs) driving clusters of traits by training decision tree classifiers on the input data with each cluster at $k$=29 (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
Several of the LVs were well-aligned to existing pathways (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap), while others were not aligned to prior knowledge but expressed in relevant tissues (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:clustering:novel:heatmap).
Some LVs were highly specific to certain traits, while others were associated with a wide range of phenotypes (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap).
We used regression to determine whether these LVs were significantly associated with different traits.
For example, LV928 and LV30, which were associated with early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004], were expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv928 and @fig:sup:lv30) and associated with red blood cell assays (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv928, @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv928, and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv30).
LV730, expressed in thrombocytes from different cancer samples (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv730 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv730), was associated with hematological assays on platelets (FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv730).
LV598, expressed in corneal endothelial cells (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv598 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv598), was associated with keratometry measurements (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv598).


At $k=10$, sub-branches of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases merged (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
We found two LVs that may affect one or both of these types of diseases.
LV57 (expressed in T cells; Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv57, Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv57) was strongly associated with autoimmune disorders in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv57) and with deep venous thrombosis in both PhenomeXcan and eMERGE.
In contrast, LV844 was more autoimmune-specific, with associations to polymyalgia rheumatica, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv844), but not replicated in eMERGE.
This LV was expressed in a range of cell types, including blood, breast organoids, myeloma cells, lung fibroblasts, and different cell types from the brain (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv844, Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv844).


The cardiovascular sub-branch had 129 significant associations between gene expression and traits in PhenomeXcan and 23 in eMERGE.
LV136, associated with coronary artery disease and keratometry measurements in PhenomeXcan, was also associated with coronary atherosclerosis in eMERGE.
This LV was expressed in a wide range of cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes.
Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were grouped by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types.
For example, Alzheimer's disease (not present in eMERGE) was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan.
This LV was strongly expressed in a variety of soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages (including microglia from cortex samples), and aortic valves.
It was also strongly associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia in eMERGE.
Macrophages play a key role in the reverse cholesterol transport and thus atherogenesis, and lipid metabolism in microglia has been identified as an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
