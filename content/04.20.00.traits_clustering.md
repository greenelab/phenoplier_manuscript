### Clusters of traits in the gene module space are associated with relevant transcriptional processes

**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
<!--  -->
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on $n$=3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the input data, and the three data versions are processed by five different clustering algorithms.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different sets of parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits were grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different number of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions are represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
<!--  -->
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function are used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

The previous results suggest that $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ represents a less noisy low-dimentional version of the data.
Thus, we conducted cluster analysis on $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ to find groups of traits that are similarly affected by the same transcriptional processes.
To avoid using a single clustering algorithm (which implies using a single assumption about the structure of the data), we employed a consensus clustering approach where different methods with varying sets parameters were applied on the data, and later combined into a consolidated solution [@doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.237; @Strehl2002; @doi:10.1016/j.ins.2016.04.027] (Figure @fig:clustering:design).
Our clustering pipeline generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions with 5 to 29 clusters (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:consensus_agreement).
Instead of selecting a specific number of clusters, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to examine stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions.

Finally, for the interpretation of the clusters, we trained a decision tree classifier (a highly interpretable machine learning model) on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels.
This allowed us to quickly identify the latent variables/gene modules that better differentiated the groups of traits found (see Methods).

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
<!--  -->
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition, and the number of clusters go from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

The clustering tree in Figure @fig:clustering:tree shows five clear branches that ar shown at the top with different numerical labels (cluster IDs from left to right):
0) a "large" branch that includes most of the traits that start to be subdivided only at $k$=16 (with asthma, well-being traits, and nutrient intake clusters),
1) heel bone-densitometry measurements,
2) hematological assays on red blood cells,
3) physical measures, including spirometry and body impedance, and anthropometric traits with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches, and
4) a "complex" branch including keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders (psoriasis, hyper/hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infraction, hypercholesterolemia, and other cardiovascular-related traits such hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160], and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet).
<!--  -->
All branches show relatively highly stable clusters, where the same traits are clustered together across different resolutions even with the consensus algorithm using random seeds at each level.
<!--  -->
The arrows between different clusters show how traits move from one group to another across different resolutions.
This mainly happens between clusters within the "complex" branch and between clusters from the "large" branch to the "complex" branch.
This is expected, since the "complex" branch contains disease entities related to a wide range of different factors and thus are hard to categorize into a single cluster.


Within the cardiovascular diseases sub-branch, we also found mental and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
<!--  -->
The link between mental disorders and those affecting the caridiovascular system have been documented for decades [@pmid:12093424; @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002065; @doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.117.202606; @doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313563], where both conditions share many risk factors, including hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, among others [@doi:10.1186/s12916-014-0206-2; @doi:10.1111/j.1076-7460.2007.06696.x].
<!--  -->
In our results, however, these diseases were grouped by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types.
<!--  -->
Alzheimer's disease (GWAS $n$=54162 with 17008 cases from [@pmid:24162737]), for example, was significantly associated with LV21 (FDR = 1.64e-19) and with LV5 (FDR = 3.06e-03).
LV21 was strongly expressed in monocytes/macrophages, including microglia from the brain (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv21), which play a key role in the reverse cholesterol transport and thus atherogensis [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hci136] (`CONNECT WITH NIACIN PART BEFORE`{.red});
and LV5 was expressed in brain glioblastomas samples [@doi:10.1126/science.1254257], U87 human glioma cells [@doi:10.1186/s13059-015-0684-3], microglia (brain), liver and kidney, among other cell types (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv5).
LV21 and LV5 were also strongly associated with lipids [@pmid:27005778]: LDL cholesterol ($n$=13527; FDR < 0.001), and triglycerides ($n$=21559; FDR < 0.05 and FDR < 0.001, respectively).
Additionally, LV5 was associated with several depression traits (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:lv5).
<!--  -->
ADHD ($n$=53293 with 19099 cases) was the only significantly associated trait for LV434 (FDR < 0.01), which was expressed in breast cancer and glioma cells, cerebral organoids, and several different cell populations from the brain: fetal neurons (mainly in replicating, but also quiescence), microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv434).

Schizophrenia was not significantly associated with any gene module tested in our analysis.


- mention if these lvs are aligned to previous knowledge
- try to replicate in eMERGE
- qqplots of pvalues (raw) for each LV? just to see if there is any outlier (read paper!)



Next, we analyzed which gene modules are driving these clusters of traits.
For that, we trained decision tree classifiers on the input data (Figure @fig:clustering:design) using each cluster at $k=26$ (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree) as labels (see Methods).
This yielded for each cluster the top associated gene modules, where several of them were well-aligned to existing pathways, and other modules were "novel" and expressed in relevant tissues (`Add figure/see notes below`{.red}).
Results are shown in Supplementary Figures @fig:clustering:heatmap and @fig:clustering:heatmap_pathways, where it can be seen that some modules are highly specific to certain types of traits, and others seem to be associated with a wide range of different traits and diseases, thus potentially involved in more general biological functions.
For example, modules such as LV928 and LV30, that are known to be related to early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004], are predominantly expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis, and strongly associated with different assays on red blood cells (erythrocytes and reticulocytes, including cell counts, mean volumes and distribution width).
On the other side, others are highly specific, such as LV730, expressed in thrombocytes, and exclusively associated with hemathological assays on platelets;
or LV598, whose genes are expressed in corneal endothelial cells, and are almost only related to keratometry measurements.
<!-- 
LV154 is also expressed in corneal endothelial cells and associated with keratometry, but not exclusively.
 -->

<!--
Autoimmune diseases are very similar, as it can be seen, but some modules show highly specific associations: for example, I THINK, thyroid-related disorders with LV155 (with genes expressed in thyroid)
-->



`Notes:`{.red}

::: {style="color: red"}
- For the last paragraph, generate a figure showing the top cell types/tissues per cluster.
For example, for the asthma cluster it would be nice to see relevant tissues for tis top gene modules.
- Check that the examples of traits moving from different clusters are obvious and expected.
No reviewer should stop thinking if it is expected that trait X moves to the cluster of trait Y.
- Ben's question about why we expect these clustering results.
My answer was more or less that far apart clusters are explained by more specific LVs to those traits, and the complex branch is more related to traits that are highly connected to all biological processes, where more subtle differences are captured only at higher resolutions.
- Clustering tree: I need help to define some clusters, in particular, Cluster 14 (Heart problems). Here we have myocardian infraction, heart attack (I guess they are the same), coronary atherosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease (wide definition). I guess many are the same, but not sure.
- I'm using an asterisk for the "Cardiovascular diseases" branch in figure clustering tree, but it is actually a mixture of that, autoimmune and psychiatry traits.
- (say this later, after the first review of the manuscript) The fact that we are combining z-scores might be problematic (stouffer method) when computing LV associations
Minor:

- In Figure @fig:clustering:design, add a label showing that we generate several consensus clustering partitions.
Now it seems that we only generate one.
