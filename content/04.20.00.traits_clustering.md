### LV projections reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
<!--  -->
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on $n$=3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the input data, and the three data versions were processed by five different clustering algorithms.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different sets of parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits were grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different number of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions were represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
<!--  -->
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function were used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

The previous results suggested that the compression into $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ increases the signal-to-noise ratio.
Thus, we analyzed $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ to find groups of traits that were affected by the same transcriptional processes.
To identify relationships that were robust to the selection of a specific clustering algorithm (each of which makes particular assumptions about the structure of data), we employed a consensus clustering approach.
Therefore, we applied different methods with varying sets of parameters and later combined these into a consolidated solution (Methods).
Our clustering pipeline generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions with 5 to 29 clusters (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:consensus_agreement).
Instead of selecting a specific number of clusters, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to examine stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions.
To understand which latent variables differentiated the group of traits, we trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels.

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
<!--  -->
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition.
The number of clusters go from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

We found that phenotypes grouped into five clear branches (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
These were
0) a "large" branch that includes most of the traits subdivided only starting at $k$=16 (with asthma, subjective well-being traits, and nutrient intake clusters),
1) heel bone-densitometry measurements,
2) hematological assays on red blood cells,
3) physical measures, including spirometry and body impedance, and anthropometric traits with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches, and
4) a "complex" branch including keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders (type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, hyper/hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease), and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, myocardial infraction, hypercholesterolemia, and other cardiovascular-related traits such hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160], and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet) (See Supplementary Files 1-5 for clustering results).
Within these branches, results were relatively stable.
The same traits were often clustered together across different resolutions, even with the consensus algorithm using random initializations at each level.
Arrows between different clusters show traits moving from one group to another across different resolutions.
This mainly happens between clusters within the "complex" branch, and between clusters from the "large" branch to the "complex" branch.
We would expect that continuing to explore higher dimensionalities would result in further subdivisions of these large groupings.
This behavior was expected since complex diseases are usually associated with shared genetic and environmental factors and are thus hard to categorize into a single cluster.
We would also expect that exploring solutions with a larger number of clusters would result in further subdivisions of these large groupings.

**Cluster-specific and general transcriptional processes associated with disease.**
The plot shows a submatrix of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ for the main trait clusters at $k$=29, considering only LVs (rows) that are well-aligned with at least one pathway.
Standardized values from -5 (lighter color) to 16 (darker color).

Next, we analyzed which LVs were driving these clusters of traits.
We trained decision tree classifiers on the input data (Figure @fig:clustering:design) using each cluster at $k$=29 (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree) as labels (see Methods).
This yielded for each cluster the top LVs, where several of them were well-aligned to existing pathways, and others were "novel" and expressed in relevant tissues.
We summarized this in Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap, where it can be seen that some LVs were highly specific to certain types of traits, while some were associated with a wide range of different traits and diseases, thus potentially involved in more general biological functions.
For example, LVs such as LV928 and LV30 (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv928 and @fig:sup:lv30), which were well-aligned to early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004], were predominantly expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis, and strongly associated with different assays on red blood cells (erythrocytes and reticulocytes).
On the other side, others, such as LV730, were highly specific and expressed in thrombocytes from different cancer samples (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv730), and strongly associated with hematological assays on platelets;
or LV598, whose genes were expressed in corneal endothelial cells (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv598) and associated with keratometry measurements (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv598).
<!-- 
LV154 is also expressed in corneal endothelial cells and associated with keratometry, but not exclusively.
 -->


The autoimmune diseases sub-branch also had significant LVs associations expressed in relevant cell types.
<!--  -->
LV155 was strongly expressed in thyroid (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv155), and significantly associated with hypothyroidism both in PhenomeXcan and eMERGE (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv155 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv155).
<!--  -->
LV844 was the most strongly associated gene module with autoimmune disorders (FDR < 1e-15; Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv844 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv844), and was expressed in a wide range of cell types, including blood, breast organoids, myeloma cells, lung fibroblasts, and different cell types from the brain (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv844).
<!--  -->
Other important LVs associated with autoimmunity in both PhenomeXcan and eMERGE were LV57 expressed in T cells (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv57, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv57 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv57), and LV54 expressed in different soft tissue tumors, breast, lung, pterygia and epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv54, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv54 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv54).


The cardiovascular sub-branch also exhibited significant associations, such as LV847 (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv847) with blood pressure traits and hypertension (Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv847 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv847), which was expressed in CD19 (B cells) (which are related to preeclampsia [@doi:10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.188276]), Jurkat cells (T lymphocyte cells), and cervical carcinoma cell lines (the uterus was previously reported to be linked to blood pressure through a potential hormonal pathway [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6; @doi:10.1007/s11906-006-0080-1]).
<!--  -->
LV136 was aligned with known collagen formation and muscle contraction pathways, and it was associated to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and keratometry measurements (Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv136 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv136), and expressed in a wide range of cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv136).
<!--  -->
Lipids were clustered with chronotype and Alzheimer's disease, and were significantly associated with several modules expressed mainly in brain cell types, including LV93 (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv93, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv93 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv93), LV206 (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv206, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv206 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv206), and LV260 (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv260, and Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv260 and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv260).
These modules were associated mainly with cardiovascular traits in eMERGE.


Within the cardiovascular sub-branch, we found neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
These disorders were previously linked to the cardiovascular system [@pmid:12093424; @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002065; @doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.117.202606; @doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313563], and share several risk factors, including hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, among others [@doi:10.1186/s12916-014-0206-2; @doi:10.1111/j.1076-7460.2007.06696.x].
<!--  -->
In our results, however, these diseases were grouped by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types.
<!--  -->
Alzheimer's disease, for example, was significantly associated with LV21 (FDR < 1e-18) and with LV5 (FDR < 0.01) (Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv21 and @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv5).
LV21 was strongly expressed in a variety of soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages (including microglia from cortex samples), and aortic valves (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv21);
as discussed previously, macrophages play a key role in the reverse cholesterol transport and thus atherogenesis [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hci136].
LV5 was expressed in breast cancer and brain glioma samples, microglia (cortex), liver, and kidney, among other cell types (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv5).
LV21 and LV5 were also strongly associated with lipids: LDL cholesterol (FDR < 0.001) and triglycerides (FDR < 0.05 and FDR < 0.001, respectively).
Additionally, LV5 was associated with depression traits from the UK Biobank.
<!--  -->
ADHD was the only significantly associated trait for LV434 (FDR < 0.01) (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv434), which was expressed in breast cancer and glioma cells, cerebral organoids, and several different cell populations from the brain: fetal neurons (replicating and quiescence), microglia, and astrocytes (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv434).

Schizophrenia was not significantly associated with any gene module tested in our analysis.

None of these LVs were aligned to prior pathways, which might represent potentially novel transcriptional processes affecting the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.
