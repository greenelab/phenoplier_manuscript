### Clusters of traits in the gene module space are associated with relevant transcriptional processes

**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
<!--  -->
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on $n$=3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the input data, and the three data versions are processed by five different clustering algorithms.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different sets of parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits were grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different number of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions are represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
<!--  -->
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function are used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

We conducted cluster analysis on $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ to find groups of traits that are similarly affected by the same transcriptional processes.
To avoid using a single clustering algorithm (which implies using a single assumption about the structure of the data), we employed a consensus clustering approach where different methods with varying sets parameters were applied on the data, and later combined into a consolidated solution [@doi:10.1016/j.ins.2016.04.027; @doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.237; @Strehl2002] (Figure @fig:clustering:design).
Our clustering pipeline generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions with different number of clusters (from 5 to 29).
Instead of selecting a specific number of clusters, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to examine stable groups of traits at multiple resolutions.

Finally, for the interpretation of the clusters, we trained a decision tree classifier (a highly interpretable machine learning model) on the original input data using the clusters found as labels.
This allowed us to quickly identify the latent variables/gene modules that better differentiated the groups of traits found (see Methods).

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
<!--  -->
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition, and the number of clusters go from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

The clustering tree in Figure @fig:clustering:tree shows five clear branches that start at the top with different numerical labels (cluster IDs from left to right):
0) physical measures including anthropometric traits (with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches) and eye measures (keratometry),
1) a "large" branch that includes most of the traits that start to be subdivided only at $k$=16 (with asthma, lipids, and nutrient intake clusters),
2) bone-densitometry measurements,
3) hematological assays on red blood cells and platelets, and
4) a "complex" branch including assays on white blood cells, skin and hair color, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, heart problems, and other cardiovascular-related traits such hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160], and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet).
<!--  -->
All branches show relatively highly stable clusters, where the same traits are clustered together across different resolutions even with the consensus algorithm using random seeds at each level.
<!--  -->
The arrows between clusters of different resolutions show how traits move from one group to another, and this mainly happens only between the "complex" branch and the rest, particularly with traits expected to be linked to several others, such as white blood cells, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, and other related factors.
<!--  -->
For example, the arrow from cluster 14 at $k$=16 (heart problems and related traits) to cluster 15 at $k$=22 (lipids), indicate the move of coronary artery disease, fasting glucose and blood insulin measurement to the lipids clusters, which are also highly related.

Another example is age when diabetes was first diagnosed that is moved from cluster 0 at $k$=25 to cluster 21 at $k$=26 (with autoimmune diseases such as hypo and hyperthyroidism), and intraocular pressure and eye problems from the same cluster to cluster 25 at $k$=26 (with traits related to hypertension and cardiovascular problems).
This movement of traits across highly-related clusters indicates the complexity of the relationships, where in these cases the algorithm found meaningful but changing traits at different resolutions.


Next, we analyzed which gene modules are driving these clusters of traits.
For that, we trained decision tree classifiers on the input data (Figure @fig:clustering:design) using each cluster at $k=26$ (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree) as labels (see Methods).
This yielded for each cluster the top associated gene modules, where several of them were well-aligned to existing pathways, and other modules were "novel" and expressed in relevant tissues (`Add figure/see notes below`{.red}).
Results are shown in Supplementary Figures @fig:clustering:heatmap and @fig:clustering:heatmap_pathways, where it can be seen that some modules are highly specific to certain types of traits, and others seem to be associated with a wide range of different traits and diseases, thus potentially involved in more general biological functions.
For example, modules such as LV928 and LV30, that are known to be related to early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004], are predominantly expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis, and strongly associated with different assays on red blood cells (erythrocytes and reticulocytes, including cell counts, mean volumes and distribution width).
On the other side, others are highly specific, such as LV730, expressed in thrombocytes, and exclusively associated with hemathological assays on platelets;
or LV598, whose genes are expressed in corneal endothelial cells, and are almost only related to keratometry measurements.
<!-- 
LV154 is also expressed in corneal endothelial cells and associated with keratometry, but not exclusively.
 -->

<!--
Autoimmune diseases are very similar, as it can be seen, but some modules show highly specific associations: for example, I THINK, thyroid-related disorders with LV155 (with genes expressed in thyroid)

`Notes:`{.red}

::: {style="color: red"}
- For the last paragraph, generate a figure showing the top cell types/tissues per cluster.
For example, for the asthma cluster it would be nice to see relevant tissues for tis top gene modules.
- Check that the examples of traits moving from different clusters are obvious and expected.
No reviewer should stop thinking if it is expected that trait X moves to the cluster of trait Y.
- Ben's question about why we expect these clustering results.
My answer was more or less that far apart clusters are explained by more specific LVs to those traits, and the complex branch is more related to traits that are highly connected to all biological processes, where more subtle differences are captured only at higher resolutions.

Minor:

- In Figure @fig:clustering:design, add a label showing that we generate several consensus clustering partitions.
Now it seems that we only generate one.
