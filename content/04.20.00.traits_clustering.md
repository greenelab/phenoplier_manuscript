### LVs reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

![
**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on 3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the input data, and five different clustering algorithms processed all data versions.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits was grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different numbers of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions were represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function were used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

We used a consensus clustering framework to combine solutions or partitions of traits generated by different clustering algorithms.
This approach takes into account different biases and assumptions about the data structure, and has been shown to outperform any individual member of the ensemble [@Strehl2002; @doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113].
We generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions, with the number of clusters ranging from 5 to 29.
To further explore these solutions, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] to examine stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions.
We also trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels (see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)) to understand which latent variables differentiated the group of traits.

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition.
The number of clusters goes from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

We found that phenotypes were grouped into five distinct clusters, as shown in Figure @fig:clustering:tree.
These clusters were: 0) a "large" branch that included most of the traits, subdivided only starting at $k$=16 (with asthma, subjective well-being traits, and nutrient intake clusters); 1) heel bone-densitometry measurements; 2) hematological assays on red blood cells; 3) physical measures, including spirometry and body impedance, and anthropometric traits with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches; and 4) a "complex" branch including keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (which also included other cardiovascular-related traits such as hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160], and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet).
These results were relatively stable across different resolutions, with the same traits often clustered together.
Arrows between clusters showed traits moving from one group to another, mainly between clusters within the "complex" branch (4) and between clusters from the "large" branch (0) to the "complex" branch.
This behavior is expected, since complex diseases are usually associated with shared genetic and environmental factors, making them hard to categorize into a single cluster.
Further details can be found in Supplementary Files 3-6.

**Cluster-specific and general transcriptional processes associated with different diseases.**
The plot shows a submatrix of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ for the main trait clusters at $k$=29, considering only LVs (rows) that are well-aligned with at least one pathway.

We used a decision tree classifier to analyze which latent variables (LVs) were driving the clusters of traits in our data (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
We found that some of the LVs were associated with existing pathways (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap) and some were not aligned to prior knowledge but still expressed in relevant tissues (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:clustering:novel:heatmap).
Some LVs were highly specific to certain traits, while others were associated with a wide range of different phenotypes.
We used our regression framework to assess whether the LVs were significantly associated with different traits.
For example, LV928 and LV30 were associated with assays on red blood cells (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv928, @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv928, and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv30).
LV730 was highly specific and associated with hematological assays on platelets (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv730).
LV598 was expressed in corneal endothelial cells (Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv598 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv598) and associated with keratometry measurements (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv598).


At $k=10$, the sub-branches of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases were merged together (middle of Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
We expected to find LVs that were specifically associated with one or both of these types of diseases.
For example, LV57, which is expressed in T cells (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv57 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv57), was the most strongly associated gene module with autoimmune disorders in PhenomeXcan (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv57).
It had significant associations with hypothyroidism that were replicated in eMERGE (@tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv57).
However, this LV was also associated with deep venous thrombosis in both PhenomeXcan and eMERGE.
On the other hand, LV844 was more specific to autoimmune diseases, with associations to polymyalgia rheumatica, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease in PhenomeXcan (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv844).
These did not replicate in eMERGE.
LV844 was expressed in a wide range of cell types, including blood, breast organoids, myeloma cells, lung fibroblasts, and different cell types from the brain (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv844 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv844).


In the cardiovascular sub-branch, we found 129 significant LV-trait associations in PhenomeXcan and 23 in eMERGE.
For example, LV136 was associated with coronary artery disease and keratometry measurements in PhenomeXcan, and with coronary atherosclerosis in eMERGE.
This LV was expressed in a range of cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and cardiomyocytes.
Additionally, we found neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and ADHD associated with this sub-branch.
These disorders share several risk factors, including hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity.
Our results suggest that these diseases are grouped by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types.
For instance, Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan, which was strongly expressed in soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages, and aortic valves.
This LV was also strongly associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia in eMERGE.
Macrophages play a key role in the reverse cholesterol transport and thus atherogenesis, and lipid metabolism in microglia has been identified as a factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
