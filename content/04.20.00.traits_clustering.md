### LVs reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

![
**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on 3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the input data, and five different clustering algorithms processed all data versions.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits was grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different numbers of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions were represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function were used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

We employed a consensus clustering framework to identify groups of clusters linked by the same transcriptional processes.
This approach combines solutions or partitions of traits generated by different methods with varying sets of parameters, with the aim of avoiding potential pitfalls when performing cluster analysis on biological data [@doi:10.1126/scisignal.aad1932].
We generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions, with the number of clusters of these partitions ranging from 5 to 29, learned from the data by selecting the partitions with the largest agreement with the ensemble [@Strehl2002].
To explore the clusters at multiple resolutions, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
To understand which latent variables differentiated the group of traits, we trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}b, see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition.
The number of clusters goes from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

We found that phenotypes clustered into five distinct branches, as illustrated by the Figure @fig:clustering:tree.
These branches were 0) a "large" branch, containing most of the traits, subdivided only starting at $k$=16 (with asthma, subjective well-being traits, and nutrient intake clusters), 1) heel bone-densitometry measurements, 2) hematological assays on red blood cells, 3) physical measures, including spirometry and body impedance, and anthropometric traits with fat-free and fat mass measures in separate sub-branches, and 4) a "complex" branch including keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (which also included other cardiovascular-related traits such as hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160], and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet).
Results were relatively stable, with the same traits often clustered together across different resolutions.
Arrows between clusters showed traits moving from one group to another, mainly between clusters within the "complex" branch (4) and between clusters from the "large" branch (0) to the "complex" branch.
This is expected, since complex diseases are usually associated with shared genetic and environmental factors and are thus hard to categorize into a single cluster.
(See Supplementary Files 3-6 for clustering results).

**Cluster-specific and general transcriptional processes associated with different diseases.**
The plot shows a submatrix of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ for the main trait clusters at $k$=29, considering only LVs (rows) that are well-aligned with at least one pathway.

We used decision tree classifiers to analyze which latent variables (LVs) were driving the clusters of traits.
For each cluster at $k$=29 (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree), the classifiers identified the top LVs that were most discriminative (see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
Several of these LVs were well-aligned to existing pathways (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap).
Others were not aligned to prior knowledge but still expressed in relevant tissues (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:clustering:novel:heatmap).
Some LVs were highly specific to certain traits, while others were associated with a wide range of different phenotypes (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap).
We used regression to determine whether these LVs were significantly associated with different traits.
For example, LV928 and LV30 were associated with assays on red blood cells (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv928, @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv928, and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv30).
LV730 was highly specific and associated with hematological assays on platelets (FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv730), and LV598 was associated with keratometry measurements (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv598).
These LVs were predominantly expressed in relevant tissues, such as early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis (LV928 and LV30; Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv928 and @fig:sup:lv30), thrombocytes from different cancer samples (LV730; Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv730 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv730), and corneal endothelial cells (LV598; Supplementary Figures @fig:sup:lv598 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv598).


At $k=10$, the sub-branches of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases merged together (middle of Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
We expected to find Latent Variables (LVs) that specifically affect one or both of these types of diseases.
For example, LV57 was the most strongly associated gene module with autoimmune disorders in PhenomeXcan (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv57) and was expressed in T cells (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv57 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv57).
It had significant associations with hypothyroidism that were replicated in eMERGE (@tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv57).
However, this LV was also strongly associated with deep venous thrombosis in both PhenomeXcan and eMERGE.
On the other hand, LV844 was more autoimmune-specific, with associations to polymyalgia rheumatica, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease in PhenomeXcan (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv844).
These associations did not replicate in eMERGE.
This LV was expressed in a wide range of cell types, including blood, breast organoids, myeloma cells, lung fibroblasts, and different cell types from the brain (Supplementary Figure @fig:sup:lv844 and Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv844).


In the cardiovascular sub-branch, we found 129 significant LV-trait associations in PhenomeXcan and 23 in eMERGE.
LV136, which is related to known pathways for collagen formation and muscle contraction, was associated with coronary artery disease and keratometry measurements in PhenomeXcan and with coronary atherosclerosis in eMERGE.
This LV was expressed in a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes.
Additionally, we found associations between cardiovascular disorders and neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
These disorders are known to share risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking.
Our results suggest that these diseases may be linked by shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types.
For example, Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan, which was strongly expressed in a variety of soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages (including microglia from cortex samples), and aortic valves.
This LV was also strongly associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia in eMERGE.
This suggests that macrophages may play a role in the reverse cholesterol transport and atherogenesis, and that lipid metabolism in microglia could be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
