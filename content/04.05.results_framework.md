### Integrating gene expression patterns with transcription-wide association studies

::: {style="color: red"}
Here we introduce our framework to perform the integration.

 1. Brief background on MultiPLIER and PhenomeXcan.
 1. Explanation of the framework depicted in Figure @fig:entire_process and its components.
 1. Description of initial set of results matching previous findings (neutrophil counts).

**Schematic of the PhenoPLIER framework.**

The integration process (middle) between MultiPLIER [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] (top) and
PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1101/833210] (bottom) outputs matrix $\mathbf{T}$. LV603 was previously
found to be strongly associated with neutrophil estimates when projecting a dataset of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) whole blood (WB) into MultiPLIER. After integration, this LV is also
highly associated with blood count traits, with neutrophil counts at the top.
