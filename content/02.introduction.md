## Introduction

Genes interact with each other in specific networks to carry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
Variations in these genes can alter their functional role and, at a higher level, influence disease-relevant biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6].
To better understand how genes affect complex traits, it is necessary to understand the regulation of gene expression across different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9], which should lead to improved treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].
Previous research has studied different regulatory DNA elements [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3], including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
Combining functional genomics data and GWAS data [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has helped to identify transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].


Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [1-4], an effective approach to identify biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS).
TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for genetic studies associated with human diseases [5-8].
This approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11] as well as in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [12] and drug repurposing [13].
However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.


Gene-gene interactions are essential for current theories of the architecture of complex traits, such as the omnigenic model [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038], which suggests that methods should take this complexity into account in order to identify the mechanisms underlying diseases.
Pleiotropy, or the capacity of a gene to have multiple effects, is a common phenomenon that reveals the intricate nature of gene expression networks [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0481-0; @doi:10.1038/ng.3570], where it is believed that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cell types have some influence on the trait [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
To learn these gene-gene interactions, one approach is to use gene modules, which are groups of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions [@pmid:22955619; @pmid:25344726; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
Unsupervised learning methods have been proposed to infer these gene-gene connections by extracting gene modules from co-expression patterns [@pmid:9843981; @pmid:24662387; @pmid:16333293].
Matrix factorization techniques such as independent or principal component analysis (ICA/PCA) have been shown to be more effective in this task [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03424-4], as they can capture local expression effects from a subset of samples and handle module overlap efficiently.
Thus, combining genetic studies with gene modules extracted using unsupervised learning could provide further insights into the origin [@pmid:25344726] and progression [@pmid:18631455] of diseases.

Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies.
The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis.
In this work, we show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects.
PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation.
For this, we integrated thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).
We used a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we could also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
We observed that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
Furthermore, we performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells.
We observed more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicted FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism).
This improved drug-disease prediction suggested that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space revealed stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types.
This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies.
It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.
