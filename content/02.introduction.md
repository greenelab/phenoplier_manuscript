## Introduction

<!--
# Things to remember:

1. There is some introduction in the BDS conference abstract, and also in the one for the CSHL that we didn't submit.

# Important papers

- Predicting genotype-specific gene regulatory networks
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427134v1?rss=1
I like the ideas mentioned in the abstract and introduction of this paper.

- Identification of therapeutic targets from genetic association studies using hierarchical component analysis
Highly related paper.

Cite this paper about GWAS component, gene modules, and S-PrediXcan.
Some limitations of this method:
1. They find co-expression modules in GTEx only, we do it across recount2.
1. They use weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to find modules,
   which seems simple.  We use PLIER with prior knowledge.
1. This is how they find a module: ``The eigen-gene component was then computed
   as the first principal component of the expression matrix of co-expressed
   genes''
1. ``Among 44 tissues analyzed, we generally detected 213Â±89 co-expression
   modules in one tissue.''
