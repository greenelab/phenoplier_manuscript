## Introduction

Genes interact in context-specific networks to carry out various functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259], and variations in these genes can affect disease-related biological processes at a higher level [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6].
To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is necessary to comprehend expression regulation across different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9], which could lead to improved treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].
Previous studies have identified various regulatory DNA elements [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3], including genetic effects on gene expression in different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
Combining functional genomics data and GWAS data [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has helped to identify transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, typically cause tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].


Gene co-expression networks can provide a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
To this end, MultiPLIER and PhenomeXcan are two approaches that project genetic associations through gene expression patterns to capture such interactions [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
These approaches have been used to not only better understand disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also to improve disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. 

Given the availability of gene expression data, TWAS can be used to integrate eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, and to identify biological processes that mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases.
However, TWAS works at the individual gene level and does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.
To this end, MultiPLIER and PhenomeXcan are two approaches that project genetic associations through gene expression patterns in order to capture such interactions.


<!-- A gene module, defined as a group of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions, can capture part of the complexity present in transcriptional programs to aid in the understanding of disease etiology [@pmid:22955619; @pmid:25344726; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. -->
<!-- Clustering, for instance, is among the most popular methods [@pmid:28915372; @pmid:23467089], although it can miss patterns only present in a subset of conditions and usually cannot assign a gene to multiple modules. -->
Matrix factorization techniques like independent or principal component analysis (ICA/PCA) have shown superior performance in this task [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03424-4] since they capture local expression effects from a subset of samples and can handle modules overlap effectively.
Therefore, integrating genetic studies with gene modules extracted using unsupervised learning could further improve our understanding of disease origin [@pmid:25344726] and progression [@pmid:18631455].
Gene-gene interactions are essential for understanding the architecture of complex traits such as the omnigenic model [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038], which suggests that methods must incorporate this complexity to uncover disease-relevant mechanisms.
Widespread gene pleiotropy reveals how transcriptional networks are highly interconnected [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0481-0; @doi:10.1038/ng.3570], with potentially all genes expressed in disease-relevant cell types having some effect on the trait [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
To learn these interactions, the concept of gene module can be used.
This is a group of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions [@pmid:22955619; @pmid:25344726; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259], and several unsupervised approaches have been proposed to infer these connections by extracting gene modules from co-expression patterns [@pmid:9843981; @pmid:24662387; @pmid:16333293].

Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies.
The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis.
In this work, we show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects.
PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation.
For this, we integrated thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).
We used a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we could also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
We observed that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
Furthermore, we performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells.
We observed more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicted FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism).
This improved drug-disease prediction suggested that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space revealed stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types.
This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies.
It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.
