### Clustering of LVs (gene modules) with similar trait associations

::: {style="color: red"}
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to include this, but I leave it here just in case.

The idea here is to cluster LVs by seeing how are they associated with different traits. So, taking
the keratometry cluster shown before as an example, here LV136, LV767, LV612 (and possibly others)
would be clustered together. The use case would be to start from a trait of interest and see the
cluster of LVs associated with it.
