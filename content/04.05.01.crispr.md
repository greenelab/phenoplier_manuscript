### Genes causally involved in lipids accumulation are associated with relevant traits and tissues

We found 492 genes associated with lipids accumulation by using a genome-wide lentiviral pooled CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 19,114 genes in the human genome (see Methods).
From these, we identified two high-confidence gene-sets that either caused a decrease (96 genes) or an increase (175 genes) of lipids.
Next, we used these two gene-sets to assess whether singe gene-trait associations in PhenomeXcan recapitulated lipids-related traits.
We show that our gene module-based approach is more robust to identify genetic associations with lipids-relevant traits, and that it can be used to contextualize these results by identifing tissue and cell type-specific gene-trait associations.


First, using these two gene-sets, we assessed the genes' effects on all 3,752 phenotypes in PhenomeXcan by adding their standardized effect sizes and obtaining a ranked list of traits.
The top associated traits for genes in the decreasing-lipids gene-set were highly relevant to lipid levels, such as hypertension, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and vascular diseases.
Other associated traits included asthma and lung function.
We also performed the same operation for our gene module-based approach by considering 24 modules significantly enriched with the decreasing-lipids gene-set (Gene-set enrichment analysis, FDR < 0.05).
In this case, we also found highly lipids-relevant traits among the top 25, including hypertension, blood pressure, specific cardiometabolic diseases like atherosclerosis, and celiac disease.
This is particularly relevant because each of the 24 modules aggregated a specific weighted combination of almost 3,000 genes' effect sizes across all 3,752 traits.
Thus, aggregating the effects of this number of genes and obtaining top-ranked lipids-relevant traits is highly unlikely to happen by chance ($P < 0.001$, see Methods), suggesting that gene modules (discovered with an unsupervised method) represent functionally meaningful units.

When we considered the increasing-lipids set, genes and modules were associated with a more diverse set of traits, such as blood count tests, whole-body bioelectrical impedance measures, severe asthma, lung function, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Additionally, gene modules were also associated with blood lipids, arterial stiffness, intraocular pressure, handgrip strength, and celiac disease.
One gene module (LV246), significantly enriched with the increasing-lipids gene-set, was also associated with lipids metabolism and triglyceride biosynthesis pathways.
In Figure @fig:lv246 a, we used our module-based approach to show that LV246 genes are mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue, and to a less extent, liver cells (hepatocytes), which play key roles in coordinating and regulating lipids metabolism.
This LV was associated with blood lipids, hypercholesterolemia, cholesterol lowering medication, and family history of heart disease, among others (Figure @fig:lv246 b).
Two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* (responsible for encoding important enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis), accounted for most of the gene-set enrichment signal for LV246.
However, as it can be seen in Figure @fig:lv246 b, these two genes are not strongly associated with any of the top traits for this LV;
other members of this module, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR* and *LDLR*, were instead significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-relevant traits.
This suggests that a module-based perspective can contextualize and reprioritize TWAS hits using modules of functionally related genes.


`Notes:`{.red}

::: {style="color: red"}
- Improve description of CRISPR analysis.
- Genes *DGAT2* and *ACACA* are part of the high-confidence set, not the merged one (combining high and medium confidence). We might want to distinguish between them in Methods.
- It would be good at some point to have an LV that does not match a pathway.
Otherwise, a reviewer could say "but this is similar to a method computing an association between pathways and traits, where is the novelty here?".
A potential candidate could be LV504, significantly enriched with the increasing-lipids gene-set, associated with medication for blood pressure, asthma, celiac disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Genes in this LV are expressed in skeletal muscle cells, intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts, embryonic kidney cells, lung fibroblast cells, etc.
- We need to standardize the way we refer to our method (gene module-based approach, PhenoPLIER, etc).

Minor:

- Add -log10(p-value) in the legend of figure.
- Maybe make *DGAT2* and *ACACA* gene names bold in figure.
- It would be great to be able to say "this LV is _significantly associated_ with this trait". Some reviewers might want that.
Maybe we could use the Summary-MultiXcan approach to estimate the multivariate regression coefficients from individual genes associations, and get a p-value for the module-trait association.
This could be a future small project, maybe an application note.
One way to quickly compute a p-value is to use MAGMA gene-set analysis.
