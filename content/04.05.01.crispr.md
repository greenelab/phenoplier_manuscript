### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

Our first experiment attempted to answer whether genes in a disease-relevant LV could represent potential therapeutic targets.
For this, we performed a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 in the HepG2 cell line and identified 462 genes associated with lipid regulation ([Methods](#sec:methods:crispr)).
From these, we selected two gene sets that either caused a decrease or increase of lipids: a lipids-decreasing gene-set with eight genes: *BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*; and a lipids-increasing gene-set with six genes: *ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR* (Supplementary File 2).
We then analyzed the expression levels of these genes in the LVs of patients with the disease and healthy controls.
Our results showed that the expression levels of the lipids-decreasing gene-set were lower in the LVs of patients with the disease than in those of healthy controls, while the expression levels of the lipids-increasing gene-set were higher in the LVs of patients with the disease than in those of healthy controls (Figure 4A).
These results suggest that the lipids-decreasing gene-set might represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of LV.

The top 40 genes in LV246 are shown, sorted by their LV weight (matrix $\mathbf{Z}$), from largest (the top gene *SCD*) to smallest (*FAR2*);
*DGAT2* and *ACACA*, in boldface, are two of the six high-confidence genes in the lipids-increasing gene set from the CRISPR screen.

Next, we analyzed all 987 LVs using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and found 15 LVs nominally enriched (unadjusted *P* < 0.01) with these lipid-altering gene-sets (Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:lipids_crispr:modules_enriched_increase and @tbl:sup:lipids_crispr:modules_enriched_decrease).
Among those with reliable sample metadata, LV246, the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure {@fig:lv246}a), which plays a key role in coordinating and regulating lipid metabolism.
Using our regression framework across all traits in PhenomeXcan, we found that gene weights for this LV were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246, FDR < 1e-23).
These lipids-related associations also replicated across the 309 traits in eMERGE (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv246), where LV246 was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia (phecode: 272.11, FDR < 4e-9), hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1, FDR < 4e-7) and disorders of lipoid metabolism (phecode: 272, FDR < 4e-7).


Two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, are responsible for encoding enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246 (Figure b, in boldface).
However, in contrast to other members of LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated nor colocalized with any of the cardiovascular-related traits and thus would not have been prioritized by TWAS alone; instead, other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits.
This lack of association of two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen might be explained from an omnigenic point of view.
Assuming that the TWAS models for *DGAT2* and *ACACA* capture all common *cis*-eQTLs (the only genetic component of gene expression that TWAS can capture) and there are no rare *cis*-eQTLs, these two genes might represent "core" genes (i.e., they directly affect the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes), and many of the rest in the LV are "peripheral" genes that *trans*-regulate them.
