### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

We performed a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes associated with lipid accumulation.
We found 271 genes associated with lipids accumulation by using a genome-wide lentiviral pooled CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 19,114 genes in the human genome in the HepG2 cell line.
From these, we identified two gene-sets that either caused a decrease (96 genes in total, with eight high-confidence genes: *BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*) or an increase of lipids (175 genes in total, with six high-confidence genes: *ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*) (Supplementary File 1).
Four LVs were significantly enriched for these lipid-altering gene-sets (FDR<0.05) (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:lipids_crispr:modules_enriched).


First, for each lipid-altering gene-set, we assessed the genes' effects on all phenotypes by adding their $p$-values (from S-MultiXcan, transformed to $z$-scores, with no direction of effect and standardized to account for large sample sizes) and obtaining a ranked list of traits.
The top associated traits for genes in the decreasing-lipids gene-set were highly relevant to lipid levels, such as hypertension, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and vascular diseases, also including asthma and lung function (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:single_genes:lipids_decreasing:top_traits).
We performed the same operation for our LV-based approach by considering 24 LVs nominally enriched (unadjusted $p$-value < 0.05) with the decreasing-lipids gene-set by using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) [@doi:10.1101/060012].
In this case, we also found lipid-related traits among the top 25, including hypertension, blood pressure, cardiometabolic diseases like atherosclerosis, and celiac disease (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:modules:lipids_decreasing:top_traits).

When we considered the increasing-lipids gene-set, genes and LVs were associated with a more diverse set of traits, such as blood count tests, impedance measures, and bone-densitometry (Supplementary Tables @tbl:sup:single_genes:lipids_increasing:top_traits and @tbl:sup:modules:lipids_increasing:top_traits).
FGSEA found 27 LVs nominally enriched for the increasing-lipids gene-set which were associated with the same traits, and additionally to lung function, arterial stiffness, intraocular pressure, handgrip strength, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease.
Among these, LV246 contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure @fig:lv246 a), which plays a key role in coordinating and regulating lipid metabolism.
<!-- Gene-trait associations and colocalization for the top genes in this LV are shown in Figure @fig:lv246 b). -->
Additionally, using the gene-property analysis, we found that gene weights for this LV were predictive of gene associations for blood lipids and hypercholesterolemia (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246).
Two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, are responsible for encoding enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246.
However, as it can be seen in Figure @fig:lv246 b, these two genes were not strongly associated with any of the top traits for this LV and thus would not be revealed by TWAS alone;
other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, were instead significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits.
This suggested that an LV-based perspective can integrate hits across modalities by leveraging information from functionally related genes.
