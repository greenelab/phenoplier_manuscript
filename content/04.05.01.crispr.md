### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9 fluorescence-based experiment in the HepG2 cell line to identify genes associated with lipid regulation.
This experiment yielded 462 genes, from which we selected two high-confidence gene sets: a lipids-decreasing gene-set with eight genes (*BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*) and a lipids-increasing gene-set with six genes (*ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*) (Supplementary File 2).
We used these gene sets to examine whether they could represent potential therapeutic targets for a disease-relevant LV.

The top 40 genes in LV246 are shown, sorted by their LV weight (matrix $\mathbf{Z}$), from largest (the top gene *SCD*) to smallest (*FAR2*);
*DGAT2* and *ACACA*, in boldface, are two of the six high-confidence genes in the lipids-increasing gene set from the CRISPR screen.

We analyzed 987 latent variables (LVs) using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA), and found 15 LVs that were nominally enriched with lipid-altering gene-sets (unadjusted *P* < 0.01).
Among those with reliable sample metadata, LV246 was the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, and contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure {@fig:lv246}a).
Our regression framework showed that gene weights for this LV were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (FDR < 1e-23).
These lipids-related associations were also replicated across the 309 traits in eMERGE, where LV246 was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia (phecode: 272.11, FDR < 4e-9), hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1, FDR < 4e-7) and disorders of lipoid metabolism (phecode: 272, FDR < 4e-7).


Our CRISPR screening identified two high-confidence genes, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, which encode enzymes involved in triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis.
These genes were among the most highly weighted members of LV246 (Figure {@fig:lv246}b, in boldface).
However, unlike other LV246 members, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated with any cardiovascular-related traits, nor did they colocalize with them.
On the other hand, *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR* were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits.
This lack of association of two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen could be explained from an omnigenic point of view [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
It is possible that the TWAS models for *DGAT2* and *ACACA* captured all common *cis*-eQTLs and there are no rare *cis*-eQTLs.
This would mean that these two genes are "core" genes that directly affect the trait, while the other members of LV246 are "peripheral" genes that *trans*-regulate them.
