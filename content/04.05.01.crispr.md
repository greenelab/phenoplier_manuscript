### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

We conducted a gene co-expression analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets for lipid regulation ([Methods](#sec:methods:coexp)).
This analysis revealed two clusters of genes associated with lipid regulation: a cluster of genes associated with decreased lipids (cluster 1) and a cluster of genes associated with increased lipids (cluster 2).
We found that the genes in our high-confidence gene sets were strongly associated with their respective clusters (Figure 1).
This result suggests that the genes in our high-confidence gene sets may represent potential therapeutic targets for lipid regulation.

We analyzed 987 latent variables (LVs) using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and identified 15 LVs that were nominally enriched with lipid-altering gene-sets (unadjusted *P* < 0.01; Supplementary Tables).
Among those with reliable sample metadata, LV246 was the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, and contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure {@fig:lv246}a).
Using our regression framework, we found that gene weights for this LV were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246, FDR < 1e-23).
These associations were also replicated in the 309 traits in eMERGE (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv246), where LV246 was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia (phecode: 272.11, FDR < 4e-9), hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1, FDR < 4e-7) and disorders of lipoid metabolism (phecode: 272, FDR < 4e-7).


Our analysis of *DGAT2* and *ACACA* highlights the importance of combining functional genomics with genetic studies to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
Two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246 (Figure {@fig:lv246}b, in boldface).
Although these genes were not associated nor colocalized with any of the cardiovascular-related traits, other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits.
This suggests that these two genes may represent "core" genes, which directly affect the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes, while the rest of the genes in the LV are "peripheral" genes that *trans*-regulate them.
Our findings emphasize the importance of combining functional genomics and genetic studies to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and to prioritize therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.
