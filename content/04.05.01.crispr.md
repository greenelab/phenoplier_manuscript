### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

We conducted an experiment to determine whether genes in a disease-relevant LV could be potential therapeutic targets.
To do this, we used a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 in the HepG2 cell line and identified 462 genes associated with lipid regulation (see Methods section).
We then selected two high-confidence gene sets: one that caused a decrease in lipids (8 genes: BLCAP, FBXW7, INSIG2, PCYT2, PTEN, SOX9, TCF7L2, UBE2J2) and one that caused an increase (6 genes: ACACA, DGAT2, HILPDA, MBTPS1, SCAP, SRPR; see Supplementary File 2).

We analyzed 987 LVs using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and found 15 LVs that were nominally enriched with lipid-altering gene-sets (unadjusted *P* < 0.01, Supplementary Tables).
Among those with reliable sample metadata, LV246, the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure {@fig:lv246}a).
We used our regression framework across all traits in PhenomeXcan, and found that gene weights for this LV were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246, FDR < 1e-23).
These lipids-related associations also replicated across the 309 traits in eMERGE (Supplementary Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv246), where LV246 was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia (phecode: 272.11, FDR < 4e-9), hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1, FDR < 4e-7) and disorders of lipoid metabolism (phecode: 272, FDR < 4e-7).


Our CRISPR screening identified two high-confidence genes, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, which encode enzymes for triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis.
These genes had the highest weight in LV246 (Figure {@fig:lv246}b, in boldface).
However, unlike other members of LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated with any cardiovascular-related traits, and were thus not prioritized by TWAS alone.
Other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits.
This lack of association of two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen could be explained by an omnigenic point of view [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014], with *DGAT2* and *ACACA* representing "core" genes (i.e., directly affecting the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes), and many of the other genes in the LV being "peripheral" genes that *trans*-regulate them.
