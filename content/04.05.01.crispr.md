### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

We conducted an experiment to determine if genes in a disease-relevant LV could represent potential therapeutic targets.
To do this, we used fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 in the HepG2 cell line to identify 462 genes associated with lipid regulation (see Methods section for details).
From these, we selected two high-confidence gene sets: a lipids-decreasing gene-set with 8 genes (*BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*) and a lipids-increasing gene-set with 6 genes (*ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*).
This information is provided in Supplementary File 2.

The top 40 genes in LV246 are shown, sorted by their LV weight (matrix $\mathbf{Z}$), from largest (the top gene *SCD*) to smallest (*FAR2*);
*DGAT2* and *ACACA*, in boldface, are two of the six high-confidence genes in the lipids-increasing gene set from the CRISPR screen.
Cardiovascular-related traits are in boldface.

We analyzed 987 latent variables (LVs) using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and found 15 LVs to be nominally enriched with lipid-altering gene-sets (unadjusted *P* < 0.01).
For those with reliable sample metadata, LV246 was the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, and contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure {@fig:lv246}a).
Our regression framework across all traits in PhenomeXcan showed that gene weights for this LV were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (FDR < 1e-23).
These lipids-related associations also replicated across the 309 traits in eMERGE (FDR < 4e-9, 4e-7, and 4e-7 for hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and disorders of lipoid metabolism, respectively).


Our CRISPR screening identified two high-confidence genes, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, which encode enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis, and were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246 (Figure {@fig:lv246}b, in boldface).
However, these two genes were not associated nor colocalized with any of the cardiovascular-related traits, in contrast to other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, which were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits.
This lack of association of two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen might be explained from an omnigenic point of view [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
It is possible that *DGAT2* and *ACACA* represent "core" genes, directly affecting the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes, while many of the rest in the LV are "peripheral" genes that *trans*-regulate them, and that TWAS models for these two genes capture all common *cis*-eQTLs (the only genetic component of gene expression that TWAS can capture).
