## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Our study demonstrates that by leveraging gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER can accurately predict disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
This approach provides a powerful tool to identify novel therapeutic targets and repurpose drugs, advancing our understanding of complex traits.
