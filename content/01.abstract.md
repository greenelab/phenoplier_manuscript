## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to gain a better understanding of the etiology of complex traits and the mechanisms of action of drugs.
PhenoPLIER incorporates gene-gene interactions to identify disease-associated modules of genes that are expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
Furthermore, it can prioritize functionally important players that lack single-gene associations, providing a more comprehensive view of gene-trait associations.
