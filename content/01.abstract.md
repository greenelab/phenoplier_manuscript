## Abstract {.page_break_before}

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides insights into the mechanisms of complex traits, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
This computational approach maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we also found that functionally important players lacked TWAS associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
These findings demonstrate the importance of gene-gene interactions in understanding the etiology of diseases and the development of new therapies.
