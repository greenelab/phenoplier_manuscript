## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
We observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking TWAS associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may miss.
Our findings demonstrate that projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns can uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
