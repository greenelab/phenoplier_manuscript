## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The research problem/question is clear: how do individual genes influence disease-relevant mechanisms?

The solution proposed is clear: using a computational approach, we can map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

The text grammar is correct: we observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

Spelling errors are fixed: we found that functionally important players lacked TWAS associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
