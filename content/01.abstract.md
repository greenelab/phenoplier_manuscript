## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paragraph summarizes the key findings of a study that used a computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
The study found that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that the approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
Additionally, the study used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked TWAS associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
