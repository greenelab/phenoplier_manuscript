## Abstract {.page_break_before}

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach, PhenoPLIER, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
Furthermore, we show that functionally important players lacking TWAS associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
Our findings provide evidence that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, and are essential for developing new therapies.
