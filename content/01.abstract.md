## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER was able to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
Additionally, it was able to prioritize functionally important players that lacked TWAS associations.
By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential therapeutic targets that are missed by single-gene strategies.
