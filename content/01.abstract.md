## Abstract {.page_break_before}

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our new computational approach, PhenoPLIER, can reveal potential disease-relevant mechanisms and drug targets that are missed by single-gene strategies.
PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
We observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked TWAS associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
Our findings demonstrate the importance of gene co-expression in understanding the etiology of complex diseases and the mechanisms of action of drugs.
